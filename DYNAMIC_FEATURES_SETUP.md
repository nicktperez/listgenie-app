# 🚀 Dynamic Features & PDF Download Setup

## ✨ New Features Added

### 1. **PDF Download Functionality**
- Flyers now download as high-quality PDFs instead of HTML files
- Uses `jspdf` and `html2canvas` for professional PDF generation
- Automatically handles multi-page flyers if content is long

### 2. **Dynamic AI-Generated Features**

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install jspdf html2canvas
```

### Step 2: Add OpenRouter API Key
1. Get your API key from [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/keys)
2. Add to your `.env.local` file:
```bash
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=your_app_url_here
```

### Step 3: Restart Your Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

## 🎯 How It Works

### Dynamic Feature Generation
1. **User submits flyer request** with property details
2. **AI analyzes the listing** (type, location, price, features)
3. **OpenRouter generates 4 unique features** tailored to the property
4. **Features are integrated** into the flyer design
5. **Each flyer is unique** and relevant to the specific listing

### PDF Generation Process
1. **Flyer HTML is generated** with all styling and content
2. **HTML is converted to canvas** using html2canvas
3. **Canvas is converted to PDF** using jsPDF
4. **Multi-page support** for long flyers
5. **High-quality output** suitable for printing

## 🎨 Feature Examples

### Before (Static Features)
- Premium Location
- Modern Design  
- Family Friendly
- Investment Value

### After (AI-Generated)
- "Luxury Waterfront Living" (for waterfront properties)
- "Historic Charm Meets Modern Convenience" (for historic homes)
- "Perfect for Growing Families" (for family-sized properties)
- "Strong Rental Income Potential" (for investment properties)

## 🔍 API Endpoints

### `/api/generate-features`
- **Method**: POST
- **Input**: Property details (type, address, price, etc.)
- **Output**: 4 unique, relevant features
- **AI Model**: Claude 3.5 Sonnet via OpenRouter

## 🚨 Fallback System

If AI generation fails:
- System gracefully falls back to default features
- User experience is not interrupted
- Error is logged for debugging
- Default features are still professional and relevant

## 💡 Best Practices

1. **Ensure OpenRouter API key is valid** and has sufficient credits
2. **Provide detailed property information** for better AI-generated features
3. **Test with different property types** to see variety in features
4. **Monitor API usage** to stay within OpenRouter limits

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Features not generating?
- Check OpenRouter API key in `.env.local`
- Verify API key has sufficient credits
- Check browser console for error messages

### PDF not downloading?
- Ensure `jspdf` and `html2canvas` are installed
- Check browser console for errors
- Try with a different browser

### Features seem generic?
- Provide more detailed property information

- Verify property type and features are filled in
